name: Modules.Map.View
summary: Map view is used for embedding native mapping capabilities as a view in your application.
description: |
    With native maps, you can control the mapping location, the type of map, the zoom level
    and you can add custom annotations and routes directly to the map. Once the map view is
    displayed, the user can pan, zoom and tilt the map using the native control gestures.

    Use the <Modules.Map.createView> method to create a map view.

    In Alloy, use the **`<Module>`** element with the `module` attribute set to `ti.map`
    and `method` attribute set to `createView` to create a map view in XML markup:

        <Module module="ti.map" method="createView" />

    All latitude and longitude values are specified in decimal degrees. Values in degrees,
    minutes and seconds (DMS) must be converted to decimal degrees before being passed to
    the map view.

    You can add [Annotation](Modules.Map.Annotation) objects to the map to mark points of
    interest. An annotation has two states: selected and deselected. A deselected annotation
    is marked by a pin image. When selected, the full annotation is displayed, typically
    including a title and an optional subtitle.

    You can add [Route](Modules.Map.Route) objects to the map to create paths between
    two or more points of interest.

    To use the `userLocation` property in iOS 8 and later, add either the
    [`NSLocationWhenInUseUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW26)
    or
    [`NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription`](https://developer.apple.com/library/prerelease/ios/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CocoaKeys.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40009251-SW18)
    key to the iOS plist section of the project's `tiapp.xml` file.

        <ti:app>

                            Specify the reason for accessing the user's location information.
                            This appears in the alert dialog when asking the user for permission to
                            access their location.

  - name: click
    summary: |
        Fired when the user selects or deselects an annotation, a polygon, a polyline or a circle.
    description: |
        Note that the `click` event is not fired every time the user clicks on the map.
        It is fired in two circumstances:

        - The user clicks on the annotation. This will select the annotation.
        - The user deselects an annotation either by clicking on the map or another annotation.
        - The user clicks on a polygon, a polyline or a circle.

        Note that only one annotation can be selected at any given time.

        The `click` event includes a value, `clicksource`, which describes the part of the
        annotation that was clicked. The `clicksource` can be one of `pin`, `title`,
        `subtitle`, `leftPane`, `rightPane`, `infoWindow` or `null`. If the user clicks anywhere in
        the info window other than `title`, `subtitle`, `leftPane` or `rightPane`, the
        `clicksource` will be `infoWindow`. If the user deselects an annotation
        by clicking on the pin, `clicksource` is `pin`. If the user deselects the
        annotation by clicking elsewhere in the map view, `clicksource` is `null`.

        For polygon, polyline or circle, The `click` event includes the following values.
        `clicksource` is a string describing the shape type. `map` is the map view instance.
        `latitude` and `longtitude` is the corresponding coordinates on the map where the user

  - name: camera
    summary: The camera used for determining the appearance of the map. Available in iOS 7.0 and later.
    description: |
        A camera object defines a point above the map's surface from which to view the map. Applying a camera to a map has the
        effect of giving the map a 3D-like appearance. You can use a camera to rotate the map so that it is oriented to match
        the user's heading or to apply a pitch angle to tilt the plane of the map.

        Assigning a new camera to this property updates the map immediately and without animating the change. If you want to
        animate changes in camera position, use the `animateCamera` method instead.

        You must not set this property to null. To restore the map to a flat appearance, apply a camera with a pitch angle of 0,
        which yields a camera looking straight down onto the map surface.
    type: Modules.Map.Camera
    since: "3.2.0"
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]

  - name: pitchEnabled
    summary: A Boolean value indicating whether the map camera's pitch information is used. Available in iOS 7.0 and later.
    description: |
        When this property is set to `true` and a valid camera is associated with the map,
        the camera's pitch angle is used to tilt the plane of the map. When this property
        is set to `false`, the camera's pitch angle is ignored and the map is always displayed
        as if the user is looking straight down onto it.
    type: Boolean
    since: "3.2.0"
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]

  - name: rotateEnabled
    summary: A Boolean value indicating whether the map camera's heading information is used. Available in iOS 7.0 and later.
    description: |
        When this property is set to `true` and a valid camera is associated with the map,
        the camera's heading angle is used to rotate the plane of the map around its center
        point. When this property is set to `false`, the camera's heading angle is ignored and the
        map is always oriented so that true north is situated at the top of the map view.
    type: Boolean
    since: "3.2.0"
    platforms: [iphone, ipad]

  - name: showsBuildings
    summary: A Boolean indicating whether the map displays extruded building information. Available in iOS 7.0 and later.
